                    What's for Dinner was soooo easy! I never have time to run to the store with my busy schedule and I needed something prepared fast. I just searched for recipes with what I had on hand, and the pizza I whipped up was delecious!

                    What can I say? I'm pretty lazy and never feel like making a special trip to the store for a couple ingredients. The chicken bacon alfredo was on point, and it impressed my lady friend. Win win!

                    The recipes here are AMAZING! I also love the fact that I can make meal plans for the week and the suggestions are always great. What's For Dinner is my new go to application when I'm cooking!
